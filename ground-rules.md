# Ground rules

## Preventing conflict

* Be courteous when aiding/assisting with different roles than originally picked.
* Communicate with the group changes being made to the repository/files before hand to prevent merge conflicts.
* Be brutally honest! Even if you're behind on your assignment others depend on you and can definitely help so hiding such info is forbidden.
* Be vocal! if something is bugging you let others know (we aren't sure if the team has mind-reading abilities, yet).

## Preventing turf-wars

* When you see someone else struggling with something you already know, reach out and help them, the more we all know the better.
* Try to go over each others code additions at least twice a week.

## Celebrating achievements

* Celebrating achievements is mandatory, even it it means we have to wear a pirate hat and raid the web cohort's fridge.

## Contact info

* Each team member has to provide their phone # and allow notifications on slack.
* Notify teams members of any changes ASAP.

## Roles (Preferred)

Raymond: User-interface.
Alexx: Database.
Jose: TBD.

## Trivial task assignment

Trivial assignments will be assigned in order, and each member is in charge of keeping track of their turn.
If there is a conflict that prevents completion by the deadline trades will be allowed, but remember to be considerate and inform
the team with enough time to have the assignment completed by the deadline.

## Meetings

* Team is required to meet every Saturday for our weekly meeting.
* Team is expected to meet after class for at least 15 minutes for our daily updates.
