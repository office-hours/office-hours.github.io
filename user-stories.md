* As an Instructor who has long days and a busy schedule, I want to have a way to save time by letting students schedule appointments with in a given period of time. This would allow me to only have office hours with students when I have scheduled appointments with them.
* As an Instructor I have limited time for office hours. I would like to have an easy way for students to schedule a meeting for a limited amount of time, so that more students can take advantage of office hours.
* As a student it can be difficult to find time during an Instructor's office hours where they are not with other students. I would like to be able to schedule a meeting ahead of time to make sure that, even if for a short time, I am able to meet with an Instructor.
